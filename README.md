`AppauthWrapper` is a `AppAuth` extension framework, which is using to reduce the AppAuth code and directly providing the short methods for Sign-in and Sign-Out, no need to manage authetication code, which is directly managing by `AppAuth` framework.Some Features of `AppauthWrapper`:
     
 1. You can directly access Sign-in and Sign-Out methods.
 2. You can access refresh token with AppAuth State.
 3. You can get refresh token by Api Call and can access api by app auth state.
 4. This Wrapper will manage your AppAuth state, save and remove your token.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements
  `iOS 9.0 or later`
  `Swift 4.2`

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but AppAuthWrapper does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding AppAuthWrapper as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SomuYadav/AppauthWrapper.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```
  
## CocoaPod

AppauthWrapper is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'AppauthWrapper','~> 0.1.0'
```
## Usage

import framework AppauthWrapper and write this code in AppDelegate

```swift
import AppauthWrapper
import AppAuth

  var currentAuthorizationFlow: OIDExternalUserAgentSession?
  var objAppAuth: AppAuth?
 
  func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                     open url: URL,
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        
        if let authorizationFlow = self.currentAuthorizationFlow,
            authorizationFlow.resumeExternalUserAgentFlow(with: url) {
            self.currentAuthorizationFlow = nil
            return true
        }
        // Your additional URL handling (if any)
        
        return false
    }
...
```

Make a constant file and write this var(s)

```swift
let clientID                   = ""
let clientSecret               = ""
let redirectURI                = ""
let authorization_scope        = ""
let registration_endpoint_uri  = ""
let user_info_endpoint_uri     = ""

let issuer                     = ""
let authorizationEndpoint      = ""
let tokenEndpoint              = ""
let endSessionPointsURL        = ""

```

Before Sign-in method call you have to initialize AppAuth Class, you can initialize in `AppDelegate` or if you want more optimization you can write before Sign-In. 
```swift
(UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).objAppAuth = AppAuth(
            clientID,
            clientSecret,
            redirectURI,
            authorization_scope,
            registration_endpoint_uri,
            user_info_endpoint_uri,
            issuer,
            authorizationEndpoint,
            tokenEndpoint,
            endSessionPointsURL
 )
```

You can use Sign-In & Sign-Out like this

Sign-In: 
```swift
 appDelegate.app?.signIn(self, { (bool) in
   if bool {

   }
 }, { (session) in
  appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow = session
 }, { (statusCode,error) in
            print(statusCode ?? 0,error)
 })

```
Sign-Out:
```swift
appDelegate.app?.signOut({ (bool) in
  if bool {
    
  }
}, { (statusCode,error) in
    print(statusCode ?? 0,error)
})
```

For Refresh token and accessToken you can use like this:
```swift
AppAuth.authState?.lastTokenResponse?.refreshToken()
AppAuth.authState?.lastTokenResponse?.accessToken()
```
